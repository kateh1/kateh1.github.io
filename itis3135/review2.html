            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Submission  Link: </strong>Link led to the proper page to be reviewed</li>
                <li><strong>File Naming: </strong>All files and folders follow proper naming conventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Colors are not pure black or white, instead a combination of multible colors. The colors are very easy on the eyes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Colors/Fonts: </strong>Site has a unique color scheme and uses the standard .css file. Font is also not the default.</li>
                        <li><strong>CRAP: </strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>It is easy to read the test and view the images on the site, I could see the darker blue being difficult to read against the lighter blue background. Contrast could potentially be slightly increased.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Repetition is used throughout the site and gives the pages a consistent and cohesive feel.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignnment: </strong>Page content is left aligned and easy to read besides the occasional use of center alignment for headers and such.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Content is organized with proximity in mind, related items are easy to find through proximity. Additional space is used when item categories are different.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Page Elements:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Header: </strong>Present!</li>
                        <li><strong>Main: </strong>Present!</li>
                        <li><strong>Footer: </strong>Present</li>
                        <li><strong>Nav Bar (optional): </strong>Present!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Header with Brand: </strong>AJ Tutoring, the brand name is present in the header throughout the site.</li>
                <li><strong>H2 element in main: </strong>Present and does not match brand name</li>
                <li><strong>Tagline: </strong>No tagline is present.</li>
                <li><strong>Footer: </strong>The footer links to Apoorva's site and has all of the validation links needed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I really enjoy the layout of the site and I think it does a very good job of meeting the needs of the client. Generally the site is quite simple but it feels appropriate for a tutor. For customers it is easy to learn about the business and find the information they need.</p>
