            <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website:</h3>
            <p>The site will be heavy on visual content to display the product content. Interagive gallaries are the top priority for visual content. I also plan to investigate whether there are any cool ways to have the user interact with photos specifically for the home page. Client may also potentially provide videos to be embedded onto the site. Forms will also be utilized on the Contact and Product pages to make it so customers can contact the business and get quotes for orders.</p>
