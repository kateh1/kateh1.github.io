				<ul>
					<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> Growing up my dad was in the army so I moved around a bunch, I have lived in 9 states so far! I lived in a few different places in NC the past 7 years and have grown to call this state home. </li>
					<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong>  I work on campus as a makerspace technician (the Hawthorn makerspace - not the cool one), I also spent my summer working as a Robotics and Code Instructor at Zebra Robotics where I got to teach K-12 kids about robots and coding!</li>
					<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a senior majoring in Computer Science and concentrating in Cyber Security. I started off as a Mechanical Engineering major with a minor in Computer Science but ended up enjoying my minor classes so much that I switched majors. I had quite a bit of experience with mechanical engineering from high school internships but do not have much of a background with computers. So the major switch has been quite an adventure, but I’ve been loving everything that I have been learning and am excited to see where I end up.</li>
					<li><strong>Background in this Subject:</strong> Coding websites was one of the first things I ever did with STEM, I played around with it when I was 10-12 but haven’t touched HTML or websites since then. Excited to relearn some things and hopefully learn a bunch of new things.</li>
					<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows</li>
					<li><strong>Courses I'm Taking &amp; Why:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>ITSC3688 Computers and Their Impact on Society:</strong> Being aware of ethics and not making evil AI computers is good</li>
							<li><strong>ITCS3112 Design and Implementation of Object-Oriented Systems:</strong> Object oriented systems seems like a cool topic to dive deeper into</li>
							<li><strong>ITSC3146 Intro to Operating Systems &amp; Networking:</strong> Degree requirement, I am scared of taking this class</li>
							<li><strong>ITIS3200 Intro to Information Security and Privacy:</strong> Cybersecurity! I don't want my personal/private data stolen and neither should you!</li>
							<li><strong>EDUC1511 Local Social Science - Public Education and Schooling in the U.S. :</strong> I need 120 credits to graduate and youth education is something I am passionate about.</li>
							<li><strong>COMM3121 Mass Communication &amp; Society:</strong> I need 120 credits to graduate.</li>
							<li><strong>ITIS3135 Web-Based Application Design and Development:</strong> Because this class is super super super duper cool.</li>
							<ul>
								<li>Am I taking too many courses? Yes! But,I want to graduate this spring. Let me know if you want to study together as that will be my entire life for the next 16 weeks!</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember me by:</strong> I have a pet hamster named Danuta and I track how much she runs every night on <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PKYlJJE68dFjGN8XEtLFntNjDQ2fxzp-eYCCAUcqLic/edit?usp=sharing">this spreadsheet.</a></li>
					<li><strong>I'd also like to Share:</strong> I like listening to music and have been to 6 concerts so far this year.</li>
