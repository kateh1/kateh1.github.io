            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Submission  Link: </strong>Link led to the proper page to be reviewed</li>
                <li><strong>File Naming: </strong>All files and folder follow proper naming conventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Design:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Constrast: </strong>Contrast makes text easy to ready and pure white/black colors are not being used. The text size is slightly small and may be difficult to read</li>
                        <li><strong>Colors/Fonts: </strong>Site has a unique color scheme and uses the standard .css file</li>
                        <li><strong>CRAP: </strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Text is mostly easy to read, the yellow text on the green background is not amazing contrast, could be adjusted to improve.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Not much content is present at the moment, but consistent headers and lists are used throughout the site utilizing repetition of elements.</li>
                                <li><strong>Alignnment: </strong>Consistent use of left aligned content besides the header and footer elements. Easy to follow the structure of the pages.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Page content is aranged in an organized manner, related elements are close in proximity and make it easy to understand related content.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Page Elements:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Header: </strong>Present!</li>
                        <li><strong>Main: </strong>Present!</li>
                        <li><strong>Footer: </strong>Present</li>
                        <li><strong>Nav Bar (optional): </strong>Present!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Header with Brand: </strong>UNCC Skateboarding Club, the brand name, is present in the header. Currently only present on the home page.</li>
                <li><strong>H2 element in main: </strong>Present and does not match brand name</li>
                <li><strong>Tagline: </strong>"Where saters unite at UNCC!
                 - tagline is present</li>
                <li><strong>Footer: </strong>The footer exists but currently only has brand name, no user pages, validation, etc. yet</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall the start of the site looks good! I saw the ideas for some functionality such as having a competition sign up and sponsor logos displayed. This functionality seems very fitting or the site once it is implemented. The design of the website is slightly bland at the moment but adding images and such should help with this. The current skeleton is a very good start.</p>
