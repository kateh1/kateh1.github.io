            <h2>About us</h2>
            
            <h3>Who we Are</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Excalibur Tees, a small, family-owned, custom tee shirt manufacturing business based in Holly Springs, NC. Established in 2024, our business is the culmination of our family's creativity, dedication, and a shared passion for bringing ideas to life. After years of military service and homeschooling our kids, who are now pursuing degrees in college, we were ready to begin a new adventure. Excalibur Tees was born out of this passion, combining our commitment to quality with the joy of helping others express their vision through custom T-shirts and apparel.</p>
            <p>Our journey into the world of custom clothing started long before the founding of Excalibur Tees. As parents of kids deeply involved in competitive robotics programs, specifically FIRST Robotics, we experienced firsthand the importance of branding and team identity. Designing and creating team tee shirts became second nature as we supported their efforts. We saw how these shirts could do so much more than identify a groupâ€”they could energize a team, inspire pride, and create lasting memories.</p>
            <p>We understand how meaningful personalized apparel can be for any occasion. Whether it's helping a soccer team feel united on game day, ensuring a school field trip group stays together with matching shirts, or making a family reunion extra special, we've been there. We know what it's like to want something that's not just practical but also personal and memorable.</p>
            <p>At Excalibur Tees, we bring that same level of care and experience to every project we take on. From designing bold, creative graphics to ensuring your shirts are comfortable and durable, our mission is to help bring your ideas to life. No matter the size of your group or the complexity of your vision, we're here to help make it happen.</p>
            <p>We are excited to work with you and look forward to being a part of your next adventure, one custom shirt at a time!</p>
