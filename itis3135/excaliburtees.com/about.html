                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    Excalibur Tees was founded with a simple idea: to make custom T-shirts accessible and fun for K-12 programs. As former educators and parents, we understand how important it is to celebrate school spirit, teamwork, and achievements. From our first order for a local robotics team to serving schools nationwide, we’ve grown into a trusted partner for schools everywhere.
