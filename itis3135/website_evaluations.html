                <h3><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/">https://www.samsung.com/us/</a></h3>
                <p>Samsung is a company that sells a wide array of electronics, ranging from washing machines to cellphones. Their website mainly focuses on showcasing their products and directing you to where they can be purchased. Promotions and deals are a large focus of the site, with them being displayed alongside all of the products shown.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Samsung did a wonderful job making sure there are no significant contrast issues. They have a light background with dark text and use light text on dark images. The background is quite bright and slightly strains the eyes; a more off-white shade might have been better.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>Grids are used throughout to show multiple products next to each other. The repetition of the bounding boxes gives the website a very consistent feel and makes it easier to find information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>In addition to the grids being used for repetition, the grid layout also greatly helps alignment. Content is mostly centered within its respective bounding boxes, but there are no issues with "Christmas tree paragraphs."</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Spacing between text and graphics is consistent throughout the page. The spacing is enough to keep the page from feeling crowded while still clearly understanding the images the text references.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3><a href="https://arngren.net">https://arngren.net</a></h3>
                <p>Arngren is a Norwegian page that mainly sells small vehicles such as mopeds, bikes, and ATVs. The site has a very chaotic vibe with little organization utilized. The lack of organization makes the site difficult to comprehend and navigate.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>This is likely the strongest CRAP principle for the site. They use a light background and dark text in most places. There are a few areas with dark text on dark images that make it difficult to read.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>There is very little repetition and consistency on this website. Image sizes are completely different, and even things such as the border width are inconsistent. There is no repetitive structure to be found.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>Organization is something that does not exist on this website. Images are not organized or aligned in an effective manner. They are placed all over the site, and it is difficult to find any components that align. The text is mostly left-aligned, which may give the site some credit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Some components of the site are overlapping with each other. No sense of consistent proximity between elements exists. The page feels extremely overcrowded and chaotic when you open it.</li>
                </ul>
